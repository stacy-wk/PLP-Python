# ASSIGNMENT 1: DESIGN YOUR OWN CLASS
# This is a Car class

        # Initialize car details
        self.make = make        # Car brand

    def introduce(self):
        # Method to introduce the car
        print(f"I am a {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}, ready to hit the road!")

# Inheriting from Car class

# Create Car objects

# Call their methods

# ACTIVITY 2: POLYMORPHISM CHALLENGE!
# Base class: Vehicle
class Vehicle:

# Car class inherits from Vehicle
class Car(Vehicle):

# Plane class inherits from Vehicle
class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):

# Boat class inherits from Vehicle
class Boat(Vehicle):

# Objects for each vehicle

# Call the move method for each vehicle
